# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

## Description
In this project, I dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. We explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, and calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins. We then create visualizations to present our findings effectively. This project showcases our ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling us to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:
- **ORDER ID:** Unique identifier of each order.
- **PRODUCT:** The name or type of product ordered.
- **QUANTITY ORDERED:** The number of units of each product ordered.
- **PRICE EACH:** The price per unit of the product.
- **ORDER DATE:** The date when the order was placed.
- **PURCHASE ADDRESS:** Address where the order was delivered.
- **MONTH:** Month in which the order was placed.
- **SALES:** Total sales value calculated as (Quantity Ordered * Price Each).
- **CITY:** City where the purchase was made or delivered.
- **HOUR:** Hour of the day when the order was placed.

## Visualizations
The project includes a Power BI dashboard that visualizes the analyzed data. The dashboard displays key metrics like total revenue, sales quantity, and profit margin. It also includes visualizations of sales trends over time, top-selling products, and sales distribution by city and hour.
